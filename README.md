This is capstone project of Microverse Ruby Curriculum.Project Name is **Console Jobs**.
Web scraping is the process of gathering information from the Internet. Even copy-pasting the lyrics of your favorite song is a form of web scraping! However, the words “web scraping” usually refer to a process that involves automation.
